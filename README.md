# Todo list (only most important)
- Merge teacher and student entity in database layer and below.
- Create wrapper for java.util.Scanner
- Move all dependencies of UI class to separate factory
- Clear dependency mess
- DI could be better (?)
- Clear duplicate code in services
- Harder calculations won't work with larger amount of data!


What do I plan to do with items in this todo list ? Nothing, it's school project ...
